# Forecast
This is the app which is used to provide the weather forecast of 5 days.
In this app, firstly you have to create an account on openweathermap.org(https://openweathermap.org/).
After that you will be getting your api key and you can create as many api key you want. 
After creating api key, you can use it further in your project, but remember one thing, the api key will not work just after the creation. It will
take some time to get activated by the server, so please be patient.... (It will work after approximately 1 hour).
